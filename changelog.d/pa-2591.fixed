Fix an error with rule targeting for extract mode. Previously, if a ruleset had
two rules, the first being the extract rule, the second being the rule to run,
no rules would run on the extracted targets. Additionally, with multiple rules
the wrong rule might be run on the extracted target, causing errors. Now, in
extract mode all the rules for the destination language will be run.
